::
:: Format:
::	xmrig.exe -o <node address>:<node port> -a rx/0 -u <wallet address> --daemon
::
:: Fields:
::	node address		The host name of your monerod node or its IP address. It can also be a public node with RPC enabled, for example node.xmr.to
::	node port 		The RPC port of your monerod node to connect to, usually 18081.
